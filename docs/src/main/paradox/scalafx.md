# ScalaFX

Until Version 1.5.x Sapphire depends on [ScalaFX](http://www.scalafx.org/), a DSL for JavaFX written in Scala.

Version 1.6.x and newer versions are built without ScalaFX dependency, because ScalaFX (JavaFX UI DSL) is not really needed for sapphire functionality.
However, it can be used on top of this framework as a very useful addition in writing JavaFX Applications.
